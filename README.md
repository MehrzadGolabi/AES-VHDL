# AES-VHDL + UART

This is forked project from [AES-VHDL](https://github.com/hadipourh/AES-VHDL) by hadipourh. His aes implementation requires 387 IOB to send and recieve plaintext, key and ciphertext but that was not feasible on my Posedge-1 Spartan-6 development board so I created a UART module to send and recieve Hex data.
